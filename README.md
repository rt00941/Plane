# Plane
Bachelors FYP

As a user I want to be able to enter my id and password so I can login
A simple login UI to the application before it starts rendering 

As a user I want to be able to select a plane so I can view relevant information about it
Planes that can be 'clicked' on so that a UI shows up or hides on the clicking. The UI shows all relevant information on the plane that is selected. 

As a user I want to see the direction of movement of the planes so I can know where it is going
Planes should be angled according to where they are going next.

As a user I want to have the map placed dynamically in the environment so I can see it positioned within the environment I am in and so it repositions when I move
There should be proper spatial mapping done of the surroundings before placing the map in the environment based on what surfaces there are and what their size is. The map should also be moveable while retaining its accuracy
